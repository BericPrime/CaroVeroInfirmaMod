#Caro Vero Infirma

A 1.20.1 Minecraft mod based around Flaxbeard's Cyberware mod (yes, the 1.9 one), CDDA, and Rimworld.

Designed specifically for a server with me and my friends, it might be a little janky and unbalanced alone. I highly suggest using other mods, such as Mekanism or EnderIO, as they offer power solutions.

If you find this mod, congratulations, I decided to make this public! Will I support it? Probably not! Probably.

Dependencies: Dimensional Doors. What is it used for? (secret). It does make some minor changes to the mod - but nothing too major.

AI used (begrudgingly) to aid in complex implementation. As much as I do like to think out problems for myself, it's difficult when there's little to no documentation on how to do things, and the code was written 14 years ago likely in some sort of caffeinated/sleep-deprived state.

Credit to https://www.reddit.com/user/SeiyoNoShogun/ -  I stole your iron block texture that i found on reddit. Let me know if you want it removed from what i used.
